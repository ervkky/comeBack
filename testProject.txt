Git Command:

change directory to required Folder	: cd DirectoryName
					: mkdir NewDirectoryName
to initialise git repository 		: git init

Add new file				:gedit fileName.txt

after creating see which files git known exist: git status

"HEY, WE NOTICED YOU CREATED A NEW FILE CALLED MNELSON.TXT, BUT UNLESS YOU USE THE 'GIT ADD' COMMAND WE AREN'T GOING TO DO ANYTHING WITH IT."

To add a file to a commit, you first need to add it to the staging environment. To do this, you can use the 						:git add <filename> command

It's time to create your first commit!

Run the command 			: git commit -m "Your message about the commit"

If the changes don’t conflict, you’re done. If there are conflicts, markers will be left in the problematic files showing the conflict;
					: git diff
will show this. Once you’ve edited the files to resolve the conflicts,
					: git commit -a
will commit the result of the merge. Finally
					:gitk


will show a nice graphical representation of the resulting history.
At this point you could delete the experimental branch with
					: git branch -d experimental
