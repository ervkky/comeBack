Git Command:

change directory to required Folder	: cd DirectoryName
					: mkdir NewDirectoryName
to initialise git repository 		: git init

Add new file				:gedit fileName.txt

after creating see which files git known exist: git status

"HEY, WE NOTICED YOU CREATED A NEW FILE CALLED MNELSON.TXT, BUT UNLESS YOU USE THE 'GIT ADD' COMMAND WE AREN'T GOING TO DO ANYTHING WITH IT."

To add a file to a commit, you first need to add it to the staging environment. To do this, you can use the 						:git add <filename> command

It's time to create your first commit!

Run the command 			: git commit -m "Your message about the commit"

<<<<<<< HEAD
At any point you can view the history of your changes using
					: git log
If you also want to see complete diffs at each step, use
					: git log -p
Often the overview of the change is useful to get a feel of each step
					: git log --stat --summary

It’s always better to be explicit though. What’s more, you have multiple branches here, so you need to tell git where to push (i.e. back to the remote repository you cloned from, on GitHub) and what exactly to push (your new branch).

The repository you cloned from - yours - can be referred to as origin. The new branch is called amend-my-name. 
					: git push origin BranchFile
=======
If the changes don’t conflict, you’re done. If there are conflicts, markers will be left in the problematic files showing the conflict;
					: git diff
will show this. Once you’ve edited the files to resolve the conflicts,
					: git commit -a
will commit the result of the merge. Finally
					:gitk


will show a nice graphical representation of the resulting history.
At this point you could delete the experimental branch with
					: git branch -d experimental

at this point the two branches have diverged, with different changes made in each. To merge the changes made in experimental into master, run

git merge experimental

>>>>>>> experimental

Git to add origin formate
git remote add origin https://github.com/ervkky/provideNameOfGitRepository


git commit -a -m 'change done'
