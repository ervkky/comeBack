Git Command:

change directory to required Folder	: cd DirectoryName
					: mkdir NewDirectoryName
to initialise git repository 		: git init

Add new file				:gedit fileName.txt

after creating see which files git known exist: git status

"HEY, WE NOTICED YOU CREATED A NEW FILE CALLED MNELSON.TXT, BUT UNLESS YOU USE THE 'GIT ADD' COMMAND WE AREN'T GOING TO DO ANYTHING WITH IT."

To add a file to a commit, you first need to add it to the staging environment. To do this, you can use the 						:git add <filename> command

It's time to create your first commit!

Run the command 			: git commit -m "Your message about the commit"

At any point you can view the history of your changes using
					: git log
If you also want to see complete diffs at each step, use
					: git log -p
Often the overview of the change is useful to get a feel of each step
					: git log --stat --summary

It’s always better to be explicit though. What’s more, you have multiple branches here, so you need to tell git where to push (i.e. back to the remote repository you cloned from, on GitHub) and what exactly to push (your new branch).

The repository you cloned from - yours - can be referred to as origin. The new branch is called amend-my-name. 
					: git push origin BranchFile
