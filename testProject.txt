Git Command:

change directory to required Folder	: cd DirectoryName
					: mkdir NewDirectoryName
to initialise git repository 		: git init

Add new file				:gedit fileName.txt

after creating see which files git known exist: git status

"HEY, WE NOTICED YOU CREATED A NEW FILE CALLED MNELSON.TXT, BUT UNLESS YOU USE THE 'GIT ADD' COMMAND WE AREN'T GOING TO DO ANYTHING WITH IT."

To add a file to a commit, you first need to add it to the staging environment. To do this, you can use the 						:git add <filename> command

It's time to create your first commit!

Run the command 			: git commit -m "Your message about the commit"

At any point you can view the history of your changes using
					: git log
If you also want to see complete diffs at each step, use
					: git log -p
Often the overview of the change is useful to get a feel of each step
					: git log --stat --summary
